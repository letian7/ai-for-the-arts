## 🧠 Project Goals

This portfolio explores how artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and large language models, can be applied creatively within arts and humanities contexts.

Key objectives:

- Learn and apply machine learning techniques.
- Critically evaluate ethical and social implications of AI.
- Design a creative, socially valuable AI concept using LLMs.
- Reflect on AI’s role in augmenting learning, engagement, and inclusion.

## 💡 Highlight: Creative LLM Application

My project is titled **“HeritageGPT: An AI Guide for Dialogues with Dunhuang”**.

- 🌐 Theme: Dunhuang cultural heritage and murals (e.g., flying apsaras, Seven-Colored Deer).
- 🧠 AI Role: Large Language Model (LLM) acts as a storytelling and educational agent.
- 🎯 Audience: Teenagers and university students.
- 📱 Interaction: Users engage in conversation with the AI, view images of artifacts, and learn about history through dialogue.

This application is designed to **enhance cultural learning and inclusive engagement**.

## ✍️ Reflections & Impact

Throughout the project, I explored:

- Technical learning in Python and machine learning.
- Critical issues like data bias and representation.
- Creative thinking in interaction design.
- Social and cultural implications of AI in heritage and education.
